- A web accessibility plugin, like for WordPress sites
- A professional audit
- A manual audit

### Core Principles of ADA compliance
##### Perceivable: 
- All users should be able to perceive all the information that appears on your site, like text,    images, video, and more. Even if a user can’t see your website’s text or listen to your website’s video, you need to provide an alternative.

#### Operable:
- All the core features of the site should be operable to all users. Any user, for example, should have the means to use your main navigation and any site tools

#### Understandable:
- The users should have means to understand the content of the website. For example: your site may include instructions for using a feature, like a calculator or a contact form.

#### Robust: 
- Users should have the ability to receive the same experience, even if using assistive technologies.For eg: people reading your content versus those using a voice reader should get the same content even if it’s delivered differently.
