# Addition of Descriptive Text for Images

### Alternative image is useful for users that for some reason cannot view the image. The reason can be error with image file, slow connection or using a screen reader.

#### Text for Non-Interactive Images
- The descriptive text for a non-interactive image should be written like the answer to the question in mind "How will youu describe this image to a friend in a call?'

#### Icons 
- The descriptive text for an icon should state the function of the icon rather than the image.
