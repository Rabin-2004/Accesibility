# Semantic elements

## Elements with meaning. Semantics is all about using correct tags for correct situations

## Key points:
- Tags like `<form>`, `<table>`, `<list>`, `<header>`, `<footer>` fall under semantic tags as they have meanings i.e. They describe their contents.
- Tags like `<div>`, `<span>` fall under non-semantic tags.
- Semantic tags have accesibilty features. So we should always check if some semantic tags are more suitable instead of non-semantic tags for our site.
