# Color Contrast

### Situations like reduced vision, color Blindess and high light environment require good Color Contrast. Contrast Ratio is the measure of color contrast. Higher ratio value = good color contrast. White text on white bg has color ratio 1 while  black text on white bg has color ratio 21. Ratio is not always as high as possible even though a high contrast is usually more readable than a low contrast. We should strive for 7 optimally or at least 4.5 min.

## Key Points:
# Text on Images:
- If a text on a bg image has poor visibility one can use color overlay to increase the visibility.

- An interactive component has following states: hover, focus, active, unvisited, visited and deactivated. Ensure proper contrast for all the states

- Tools like Color Ratio can be used to measure the contrast.
