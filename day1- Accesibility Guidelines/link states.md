# Link States

### A link has many states. Here are five of the most common states. In CSS terms, these are pseudo-classes: unvisited, visited, active, hover, focus

#### Underline
- Links are underlined by default. The underline makes the link acccesible to people with color blindness and other visual impairments.

#### Contrast and focus
- All states must have sufficient contrast. A focused link must have sufficient contrast to the unfocused state.

#### Hover
- A clear hover state is helpful for everyone, especially people with motor impairments. Slight change in contrast or the font weight during hover is a nice practice.
