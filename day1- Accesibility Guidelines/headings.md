# Headign Levels

### Headings are defined with the `<h1> to <h6>` tags. It is important to use headings to show the document structure and the relationships between different sections. `<h1>` headings should be used for main headings, followed by `<h2>` headings, then the less important `<h3>`, and so on.

### Key Points:
- Only one `<h1>` in a page followed by `<h2> <h3>` and so on.
- A heading should give an idea of content following it.
