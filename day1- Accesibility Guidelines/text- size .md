# Accesible Text Size

### Users must be able to change the text size without zooming the entire interface. This can be done in the os settings or the browser settings. For this we should use relative sizes on our website

### Relative Text Sizes:
- em: Relative to the parent element

- rem: Relative to the root element

- % : Relative to parent element's font size
