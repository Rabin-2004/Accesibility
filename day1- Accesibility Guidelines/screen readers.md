## A screen reader is a tool that reads your screen. Necessary for blind people, important for partially-sighted users and helpful for people with reading disorders.

### Most Common Screen Readers

- Desktop: NVDA and JAWS (Windows), Voice Over (Mac) and Orca (Linux)

### Language
`<html lang= 'en'>`
to set html language to en

`<a href="https://id.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disleksia" lang="id" hreflang="id">` Hindi `</a>`
to set language of the link to a specific one in this case hi(hindi)

### Screen reader experience improvement
- Use `<aria-label= 'something'>` if you have more than one of each landmark

- Use alt text on logos and images

- Ensure form elements are properly labeled

- Use role= 'button' for clickable non-semantic tags.
