# Buttons and Links

### Specific types of interactive components. Each of them work differently with assistive technologies. The correct use of each component helps users with assistive technologies to interact with the component. The `<button>` element should be used for any interaction that performs an action on the current page. The` <a>` element should be used for any interaction that navigates to another view.

# Key points
- If an element opens a certain menu or performs certain interactions in the same page of the website without changing the pages then `<button>` is best tag to use.

- If an element changes the page then `<a>` is best used.

- `<a href = '/' >` href attribute to specify the link destination. Use a proper URL in the href attribute. The URL can be absolute or relative.
